== Universal Dependencies
#gls("UD") is a framework for cross-linguistic grammatical annotation designed to provide a consistent syntactic and morphological analysis across a wide variety of languages. It is based on a universal set of dependency relations and part-of-speech (POS) tags, enabling multilingual parsing and linguistic comparison.
The UD framework represents syntactic structure using dependency trees, where words are connected by labeled directed edges that define their grammatical relationships (e.g., nsubj for nominal subjects, obj for objects). These annotations follow a principle of typological neutrality, ensuring that the framework remains applicable across languages with diverse syntactic structures.
The two faroese UD datasets used in this study are the @oft and @farpahc. Both datasets contain manually annotated sentences in Faroese, @oft contains... @farpahc contains... These datasets are valuable resources for training and evaluating NLP models on Faroese text, enabling the development of pos morph etc ... // TODO add more details about the datasets
