== POS Tagger and Morphologizer <outlook.pos_morph.sec>
The current #gls("POS") tagging and morphological analysis models for Faroese have achieved strong performance, particularly given the low-resource nature of the language. Leveraging transformer-based architectures and fine-tuning on Faroese-specific data has allowed these models to perform competitively in core linguistic tasks. However, to reach the level of performance seen in high-resource languages, further improvements in training data quality and diversity are essential.\
A significant limitation lies in the available annotated corpora. Much of the current training data, including resources such as @farpahc, while valuable, is relatively outdated and may not reflect contemporary usage or spelling conventions. Moreover, one of the key annotated datasets used for training includes Wikipedia articles. While the annotations themselves are sound, the underlying texts are often not well written and can contain various grammatical or stylistic errors. This introduces noise into the training process and may negatively impact the model's ability to learn accurate grammatical patterns. Additionally, the reliance on Wikipedia content introduces a bias toward formal, third-person narrative structures, which further limits the model's ability to generalize to more diverse or conversational domains. \
To move closer to the performance of models trained on high-resource languages, there is a need for the expansion and modernization of training and evaluation datasets. In particular, a new test set that better represents modern Faroese usage and reduces noise from issues in the source texts, such as poorly written or error-prone Wikipedia articles, would significantly improve both training outcomes and evaluation reliability. While the existing annotations are of high quality, the quality of the original texts can introduce inconsistencies that affect model learning. Additionally, diversifying the genre and register of the training data, by incorporating spoken language, informal writing, and dialog, would help ensure that models are robust across a broader range of real-world use cases. \
Such improvements would not only enhance model accuracy but also support the development of downstream applications like grammar checkers, intelligent writing aids, and language learning tools tailored to Faroese speakers.
