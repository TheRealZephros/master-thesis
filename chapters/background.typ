= Background <background.sec>
This section provides an overview of the background information necessary to understand the context of the study. It covers the key concepts, historical developments, and relevant research that have shaped the current state of the field.

== Transformers


=== T5
#gls("T5") is a pre-trained language model developed by Google. It is based on the Transformer architecture and is designed for text-to-text transfer learning.

=== BERT
#gls("BERT") is a pre-trained language model developed by Google.

== spaCy
Spacy is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing #gls("NLP") in Python. It is designed specifically for production use and is widely used in industry. Spacy provides a wide range of features for processing text data, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing. It also includes pre-trained models for a variety of languages and domains, making it easy to get started with #gls("NLP") tasks. The relevant features of spaCy for this thesis are the #gls("POS") tagger, morphologizer, lemmatizer and dependency parsing capabilities.
