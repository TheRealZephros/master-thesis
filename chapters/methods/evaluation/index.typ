== Evaluation <methods.evaluation.sec>
This section describes the methods used to evaluate the performance of the models. The evaluation process includes the selection of appropriate metrics and the design of experiments and the rationale behind the choices. The evaluation methods are essential for assessing the effectiveness of the models and their ability to generalize to unseen data.
Normally for a language like english, there would be multiple testsets publicly available on the internet, and many other studies would have used it to evaluate their models,so you would have other models to use as benchmarks, to compare the performance of your model, but for faroese, there are no such testsets available publicly. While there are some testsets available from Scandeval, they are not quite what is needed for this study, as they are for sentiment classification, #gls("NER"), linguistic acceptability and reading comprehension. \ \
The private corpus mentioned in @mtd.sec, was being developed at the start this thesis, so it was not available for the first six months. 
Before the private corpus was available, no testset was available so one was made. Using articles from @sprotin, and adding various errors to the sentences, a testset was created. The testset was then used to evaluate the models. The testset was not used for training or validation of the models, so it is a good representation of how well the models perform on unseen data.

=== Grammar & Spelling <methods.evaluation.grammar.sec>
When evaluating the grammar and spelling models, the precision, recall and $F_(0.5)$ scores were used as the evaluation metrics. For each errortype, the average of the scores was calculated. Then an overall score was calculated by taking the average of the scores for all errortypes. In the current state of the testset, error type does not have a comparable number of tests, so the average of the scores is not an ideal representation of the performance of the models. Another issue that is less apparent, is that each error type is not nessecarily equally important, for example, a category like *noun* inflexions is more important that something like *punctuation - exclaimation mark*, as *noun* inflexions are much more common than errors with exclaimation marks. Currently the testsets do not have a way to represent this, the way the models have been evaluated, has been a lot of manual inspection of the results, and looking at the wrong predictions, and seeing if the are actually wrong. Unfortunatel, evaluating if a sentence is correct or not, is not always as simple as have a single incorrect sentence, that is always corrected, to a single correct sentence. For example, with the sentence "Hann rakst úti á #errHighlight("myrkt") havi." The original "intended" correction was "Hann rakst úti á #corrHighlight("myrkum") havi." since that was the original sentence, but a correction that the model gave was "Hann rakst #corrHighlight("út") á myrkt #corrHighlight("hav")." While this is not the intended correction, it is still a valid correction, and the model should not be penalized for this. So the correction was added to the testset as an alternative correction. This happened with a lot of the sentences, and goes to show that making a testset for a grammar model is not as simple as just having a sentence with a single error, and a single correction, since there are a lot of possible ways to get a correct sentence. 
The way the models will be evaluated is a combination of scores and manual inspection of the results, highlighting the most common and important error types, and also highlighting the shortcomings of the models.

==== Calculating Scores <methods.evaluation.scores.sec>
The scores for the grammar and spelling models were calculated using the precision, recall and $F_(beta)$ scores. Two ways of calculating the scores were considered, the first was to compare each word in the sentence, and calculate the #gls("TP"), #gls("FP"), #gls("TN") and #gls("FN") scores on a word level. The advantage of this method is that it is more granular, and has the capacity to give partial rewards for cases where the model was able to correct the incorrect word, but has introduced a new error. The trouble with this is, if an error is introduced, that changes the offset of the words in a sentence, for example by inserting a word, it can cause every following word to be misaligned, and the model will get a lot of #gls("FP")s. The second method is to compare the whole sentence, and use a more coarse grained approach, where the model is only evaluated on whether it was able to correct the sentence or not. The advantage of this method is that it is more robust to changes in the sentence, and does not suffer from the misalignment issue. The disadvantage is that it is less granular, and does not give partial rewards for cases where the model was able to correct the incorrect word, but has introduced a new error. The first method was selected for this study, despite the risk of misalignment, it is rare enough to not be a major issue, and the upside of a finer grained score outweighed the risk.

=== spaCy pipeline <methods.evaluation.pos.sec>
The evaluation of the spaCy pipeline was done using the validation set. This was done because the scarcity of the data made it impossible to have a seperate testset, as the training set was already very small, so every little bit of data was needed for training. The training set was split into a training and validation set, using a 95/5 split. For the overall evaluation of the pipeline, the accuracy of the #gls("POS") tagger and morphologizer was used. And for each of the features of the morphologizer, the precision, recall and $F_(0.5)$ scores were used as the evaluation metrics. The results of the evaluation are presented in @pos_morph_comp and @morph_feats.
